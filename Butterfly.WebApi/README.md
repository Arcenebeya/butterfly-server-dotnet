> Web API for the Butterfly Framework

Provides an abstraction to define a RESTful API. The implementation might use different underlying web servers.

See [Butterfly.WebApi](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.WebApi) for API details.

Unless you are rolling your own implementation, you'll want to use a specific implementation like [Butterfly.WebApi.EmbedIO](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.WebApi.EmbedIO) for using an underlying [EmbedIO](https://github.com/unosquare/embedio) web server.
