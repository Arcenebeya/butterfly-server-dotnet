> Channels for the Butterfly Framework

Provides an abstraction to push data from a server to a client. The implementation might use WebSockets, long polling, etc.

See [Butterfly.Channel](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.Channel) for API details.

Unless you are rolling your own implementation, you'll want to use a specific implementation like [Butterfly.Channel.EmbedIO](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.Channel.EmbedIO) to get up and running quickly.
