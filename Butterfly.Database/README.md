> Database for the Butterfly Framework

Provides an abstraction to interact with a database including the ability to define dynamic views that publish data change events. The implementation might use a memory database, MySQL, etc.

See [Butterfly.Database](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.Database) for API details.

Unless you are rolling your own implementation, you'll want to use a specific implementation like [Butterfly.Database.Memory](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.Database.Memory) or [Butterfly.Database.MySQL](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.Database.MySQL) to get up and running quickly.
