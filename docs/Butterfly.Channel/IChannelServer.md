# IChannelServer interface

Allows clients to create new channels to the server and allows the server to push messages to a connected client. Example code...

```csharp
var channelServer = new SomeChannelServer();
channelServer.OnNewChannel("/chat", channel => {
    // Do stuff here to initialize the channel (send initial data, listen for specific data change events, etc)
    // and return any object that should be disposed when the channel is disposed
});
channelServer.Start();

// Let's say a client has now created a channel to /chat?id=123, the server can now push data to the client via...

channelServer.Queue("123", "Hello");
```

```csharp
public interface IChannelServer : IDisposable
```
