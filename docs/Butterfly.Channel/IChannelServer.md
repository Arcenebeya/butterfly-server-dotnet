# IChannelServer interface

Allows clients to create new channels to the server and allows the server to push messages to connected clients.

```csharp
public interface IChannelServer : IDisposable
```

## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [ChannelCount](IChannelServer/ChannelCount.md) { get; } | Number of channels |
| [GetChannel](IChannelServer/GetChannel.md)(…) | Retrieve a channel by id |
| [OnNewChannel](IChannelServer/OnNewChannel.md)(…) | Add a listener when a new channel is created |
| [OnNewChannelAsync](IChannelServer/OnNewChannelAsync.md)(…) | Add an async listener when a new channel is created (return an IDisposable to dispose any objects when the channel is disposed) |
| [Queue](IChannelServer/Queue.md)(…) | Queues a value to be sent to the specified channel (normally converted to JSON and transmitted as text) |
| [Start](IChannelServer/Start.md)() | Starts the channel server. Must be called after adding new channel listeners (via [`OnNewChannel`](IChannelServer/OnNewChannel.md) and [`OnNewChannelAsync`](IChannelServer/OnNewChannelAsync.md)) |

## Remarks

Initializing a channel server instance...

```csharp
var channelServer = new SomeChannelServer();
channelServer.OnNewChannel("/chat", channel => {
    // Do stuff here to initialize the channel (send initial data, listen for specific data change events, etc)
    // and return any object that should be disposed when the channel is disposed
});
channelServer.Start();
```

If a client has now created a channel at /chat?id=123, the server can now push data to the client via...

```csharp
channelServer.Queue("123", "Hello");
```

If you no longer need a channel server instance, call Dispose() on the channel server...

```csharp
channelServer.Dispose();
```
