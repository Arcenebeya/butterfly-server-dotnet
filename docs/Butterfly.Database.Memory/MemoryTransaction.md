# MemoryTransaction class

Allows executing a series of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE actions atomically and publishing a single !:DataEventTransaction on the underlying [`IDatabase`](../Butterfly.Database/IDatabase.md) instance when the transaction is committed.

Must call [`Commit`](../Butterfly.Database/ITransaction/Commit.md) or [`CommitAsync`](../Butterfly.Database/ITransaction/CommitAsync.md) to have the changes committed.

If the transaction is disposed without calling [`Commit`](../Butterfly.Database/ITransaction/Commit.md) or [`CommitAsync`](../Butterfly.Database/ITransaction/CommitAsync.md) the transaction is automatically rolled back.
