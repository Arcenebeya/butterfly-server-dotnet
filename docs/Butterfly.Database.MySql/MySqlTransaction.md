# MySqlTransaction class

Allows executing a series of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE actions atomically and publishing a single DataEventTransaction on the underlying IDatabase instance when the transaction is committed.

Must call CommitAsync to have the changes committed.

If the transaction is disposed without calling CommitAsync the transaction is rolled back.

```csharp
public class MySqlTransaction : BaseTransaction
```
