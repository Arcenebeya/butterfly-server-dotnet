# RedHttpServerChannelServer class

Allows clients to create new channels to the server and allows the server to push messages to connected clients.

```csharp
public class RedHttpServerChannelServer : BaseChannelServer
```

## Remarks

Initializing a channel server instance...

```csharp
var channelServer = new SomeChannelServer();
channelServer.OnNewChannel("/chat", channel => {
    // Do stuff here to initialize the channel (send initial data, listen for specific data change events, etc)
    // and return any object that should be disposed when the channel is disposed
});
channelServer.Start();
```

If a client has now created a channel at /chat?id=123, the server can now push data to the client via...

```csharp
channelServer.Queue("123", "Hello");
```

If you no longer need a channel server instance, call Dispose() on the channel server...

```csharp
channelServer.Dispose();
```
