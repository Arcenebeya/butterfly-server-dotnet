# ISubscriptionApi.OnSubscribe method

Define a channel that clients can subscribe. Can specify a *handler* or a *handlerAsync* (but not both) that is invoked when a client subscribes.

```csharp
public ChannelSubscription OnSubscribe(string channelKey, 
    Func<Dictionary<string, object>, Channel, IDisposable> handler = null, 
    Func<Dictionary<string, object>, Channel, Task<IDisposable>> handlerAsync = null)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| channelKey | Unique identifier for the channel |
| handler | Code to run to create subscription. Must return an IDisposable instance that is disposed on unsubscribe. Can push data to client by calling [`Queue`](../Channel/Queue.md) |
| handlerAsync | Async code to run to create subscription. Must return an IDisposable instance that is disposed on unsubscribe. Can push data to client by calling [`Queue`](../Channel/Queue.md) |
