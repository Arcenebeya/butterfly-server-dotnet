# IChannelServer interface

Allows clients to create new channels to the server and allows the server to push messages to connected clients.

```csharp
public interface IChannelServer : IDisposable
```

## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [AuthenticatedConnections](IChannelServer/AuthenticatedConnections.md) { get; } |  |
| [UnauthenticatedConnections](IChannelServer/UnauthenticatedConnections.md) { get; } | Number of connections |
| [GetConnection](IChannelServer/GetConnection.md)(…) | Retrieve a channel by id |
| [RegisterRoute](IChannelServer/RegisterRoute.md)(…) | Registeres a route |
| [Start](IChannelServer/Start.md)() | Starts the channel server |

## Remarks

Initialize a channel server instance with a single route and single default channel...

```csharp
var channelServer = new SomeChannelServer();
var route = channelServer.RegisterRoute("/chat");
route.RegisterChannel(handlerAsync: async(vars, channel) => {
    // Do stuff here to initialize the channel (send initial data, listen for specific data change events, etc)
    // and return any object that should be disposed when the channel is disposed
});
channelServer.Start();

ster a default channel that creates a DynamicView on the chat_message table sending all data to the channel
```

If a client has now created a channel at /chat?id=123, the server can now push data to the client via...

```csharp
channelServer.Queue("123", "Hello");
```

If you no longer need a channel server instance, call Dispose() on the channel server...

```csharp
channelServer.Dispose();
```
