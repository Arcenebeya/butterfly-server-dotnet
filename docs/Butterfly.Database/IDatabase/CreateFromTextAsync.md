# IDatabase.CreateFromTextAsync method

Creates database tables from a string containing a semicolon delimited series of CREATE statements in MySQL format (will be converted to native database format as appropriate).

Comments (lines beginning with --) will be ignored.

Each CREATE statement must include a PRIMARY KEY definition.

If the table already exists, the CREATE statement is ignored.

Creating your database tables with this method is not required to use the rest of the Butterfly framework (you can instead just load your schema from your existing database using !:LoadSchemaAsync.

```csharp
public Task CreateFromTextAsync(string createStatements)
```
