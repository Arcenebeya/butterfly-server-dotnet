# BaseDatabase.SelectValueAsync&lt;T&gt; method

Executes the SELECT statement and return the value of the first column of the first row (the SELECT statement may contain vars like @name specified in *vars*).

If a var is null then references in the WHERE clause like

```csharp
name=@name
```

will be rewritten as

```csharp
name IS NULL
```

and references in the WHERE clause like

```csharp
name!=@name
```

will be rewritten as

```csharp
name IS NOT NULL
```

.

If a var is an array then references in the WHERE clause like

```csharp
name=@name
```

will be rewritten as

```csharp
1=2
```

when the array is empty, rewritten as

```csharp
name='Bob'
```

when the array contains a single element 'Bob', and rewritten as

```csharp
name IN ('Bob', 'Jim')
```

when the array contains elements 'Bob' and 'Jim'.

```csharp
public Task<T> SelectValueAsync<T>(string sql, object vars = null, T defaultValue = default(T))
```
