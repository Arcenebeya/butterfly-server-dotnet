# BaseDatabase.CreateFromText method

Creates database tables from a string containing a semicolon delimited series of CREATE statements in MySQL format (will be converted to native database format as appropriate).

Lines beginning with

```csharp
--
```

will be ignored. Each CREATE statement must include a PRIMARY KEY definition. If the table already exists, the CREATE statement is ignored.

Creating database tables with this method is not required (primarily done as a convenience method for unit testing)"/&gt;.

```csharp
public void CreateFromText(string createStatements)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| createStatements |  |
