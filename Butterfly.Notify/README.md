> Notifications for the Butterfly Framework

Provides an abstraction to send notifications to users. The implementation might use email, text, etc.

See [Butterfly.Notify](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.Notify) for API details.

Unless you are rolling your own implementation, you'll want to use a specific implementation like [Butterfly.Notify.Aws](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.Notify.Aws) for AWS SES or [Butterfly.Notify.Twilio](https://firesharkstudios.github.io/Butterfly/Butterfly.Notify.Twilio) to get up and running quickly.
